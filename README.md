# Eviction Strategies Tool - Playbook-NG

The next generation of cyber incident response (IR) playbooks, Playbook-NG, is a stateless web-based application used to match incident findings with countermeasures for adversary containment and eviction. The interface ingests MITRE ATT&CK™ TTP IDs or free text describes threat actor activities on compromised assets and provides a corresponding list of recommended response actions. Users then can export the results in numerous formats such as JSON, Microsoft Word and Excel, and markdown. The application does not save information about the users or their inputs; work is cleared when the user browses off or clears the playbook. When users export a JSON file playbook, they can later upload it back into the application to view, modify and update. This allows Playbook-NG to update any countermeasures that have changed since their last visit while allowing defenders the ability to update plans with new findings in minutes. 

Playbook-NG also allows users to start with an incident template that is created and curated by CISA. These templates describe specific collections of TTPs in a campaign or event that may be used as is or customized quickly. Templates can be referenced in CISA publications, replacing the ad hoc remediation text per publication with an agile set of guidance that follows a “write once, share many” model of defensive strategies. 

In addition to providing a plan in a live crisis, Playbook-NG is ideal for generating realistic plans for tabletop scenarios. It is trivial to use Playbook-NG’s text extract functionality to paste in a report with TTP IDs and generate a playbook to use in an exercise discussion. 

A live instance of this tool is hosted by CISA at https://www.cisa.gov/eviction-strategies-tool and you may contact the maintainers of this project by emailing playbook-ng ATAT mail.cisa.dhs.gov

## Overview

### Playbook-NG

Located in /website.  
The web-app - allows building incident response playbooks based off of an existing Template, or from scratch by seleting observed Techniques and Countermeasures of interest.

#### Development

- `go run metrics/metrics.go`

binds to all interfaces

does **not** hot-reload on edit

#### Building

- `go build -o metrics/metrics metrics/metrics.go`

builds to single executable: metrics/metrics
